Developed, designed, and performed tornado simulation using numerical model:

A two-dimensional IB-LBM framework combined with re-tailored RCVM for assessing the rotation intensity of a tornadic wind over a building configuration
An IB-LBM investigation into the aerodynamic coefficients in relation to the rotation intensity of a tornado-like wind

Proposed novel mathematical algorithm to simulate fluid-struction interaction problems in more efficient and accuracy manner:

A hybrid adaptive-gridding immersed-boundary lattice Boltzmann method for viscous flow simulations
