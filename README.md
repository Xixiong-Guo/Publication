Developed, designed, and performed tornado simulation using numerical model:

[A two-dimensional IB-LBM framework combined with re-tailored RCVM for assessing the rotation intensity of a tornadic wind over a building configuration](https://github.com/Xixiong-Guo/Publication/blob/master/Xixiong_Guo%20et%20al._A%20two-dimensional%20IB-LBM%20framework%20combined%20with%20re-tailored%20RCVM%20for%20assessing%20the%20rotation%20intensity%20of%20a%20tornadic%20wind%20over%20a%20building%20configuration.pdf)

[An IB-LBM investigation into the aerodynamic coefficients in relation to the rotation intensity of a tornado-like wind](https://github.com/Xixiong-Guo/Publication/blob/master/Xixiong_Guo%20et%20al._An%20IB-LBM%20investigation%20into%20the%20aerodynamic%20coefficients%20in%20relation%20to%20the%20rotation%20intensity%20of%20a%20tornado-like%20wind.pdf)

Proposed novel mathematical algorithm to simulate fluid-struction interaction problems in more efficient and accuracy manner:

[A hybrid adaptive-gridding immersed-boundary lattice Boltzmann method for viscous flow simulations](https://github.com/Xixiong-Guo/Publication/blob/master/Xixiong%20Guo%20et%20al._A%20hybrid%20adaptive-gridding%20immersed-boundary%20lattice%20Boltzmann%20method%20for%20viscous%20flow%20simulations.pdf)
